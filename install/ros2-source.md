# ROS2 from source

To install ROS 2 on a Jetson Nano, you will need to build it from source. Here, we will provide instructions for installing ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy on your Jetson Nano with Ubuntu 18.04 (although the process should be similar for other distributions). Make sure you have a reliable internet connection, as the process involves downloading and building multiple packages.

Install required dependencies and tools:
Open a terminal and run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential \
  cmake \
  git \
  python3-colcon-common-extensions \
  python3-pip \
  python3-rosdep \
  python3-vcstool \
  wget
Install additional Python dependencies:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m pip install -U \
  argcomplete \
  flake8 \
  flake8-blind-except \
  flake8-builtins \
  flake8-class-newline \
  flake8-comprehensions \
  flake8-deprecated \
  flake8-docstrings \
  flake8-import-order \
  flake8-quotes \
  pytest-repeat \
  pytest-rerunfailures \
  pytest \
  setuptools
Set up a ROS 2 workspace:
bash
Copy code
mkdir -p ~/ros2_foxy/src
cd ~/ros2_foxy
Download the ROS 2 Foxy repositories:
bash
Copy code
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/foxy/ros2.repos
vcs import src < ros2.repos
Install dependencies using rosdep:
First, initialize rosdep if you haven't done so already:

bash
Copy code
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
Now, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro foxy -y --skip-keys "console_bridge fastcdr fastrtps rti-connext-dds-5.3.1 urdfdom_headers"
Build the ROS 2 workspace:
bash
Copy code
cd ~/ros2_foxy
colcon build --symlink-install
This process may take some time, depending on your Jetson Nano's computing resources.

Source the ROS 2 workspace:
After the build process is complete, source the ROS 2 workspace:

bash
Copy code
source ~/ros2_foxy/install/setup.bash
To source the workspace automatically whenever you open a new terminal, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:

bash
Copy code
echo "source ~/ros2_foxy/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
Now, ROS 2 Foxy should be installed on your Jetson Nano. You can test the installation by running some basic ROS 2 commands like ros2 --help.

Please note that these instructions are specifically for installing ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy. The installation process for other distributions, such as Galactic or Rolling, might be slightly different. Make sure to consult the appropriate documentation for your desired distribution.
